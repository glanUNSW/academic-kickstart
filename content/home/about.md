# Biography

I am a third year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia.  I am working with Prof. Mahbub Hassan and Dr. Wen Hu. I am also a member of the Networks Research Group at DATA61, CSIRO. I received the M.S. degree in Computer Science from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Feb. 2015, under the supervision of Prof. Myungchul Kim. Before this, I got my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, China in July 2012.
